In order for UN16 to work, it needs a filesystem with all of the basic utilities. This filesystem is provided by a microSD module. That microSD module reads a microSD card, and you'll need to follow these steps to set one up:

1) Get a microSD card. You can get them for cheap on the internet or in a stationery shop.
2) Format the SD. Where it prompts you to pick a filesystem format, pick FAT32.
3) Copy all of the files in this folder over to the microSD.
